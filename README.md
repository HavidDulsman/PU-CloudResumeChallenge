# #100DaysOfCloud - Cloud Resume Challenge


This project was created in reference to the #100DaysOfCode - Cloud Resume Challenge (https://cloudresumechallenge.dev), created by **Forrest Brazeal** and made popular by the good folks at **r/AWS**. I stumbled upon the project during one of the long days in lockdown towards the end of the challenges lifecycle, but believed it would be a great opportunity for me to brush up on my IT skills, whilst also creating something that would (hopefully!) impress during new job applications. I had alot of fun with the project is it allowed me to be creative with the design of my site, whilst also getting a chance to use some new tools within AWS i had only read up on for my AWS Certified Cloud Practioner Exam, that which i passed 12th June 2020.

This report is merely a log for anyone to look at to see some brief explaination as to my experiences with each task. Chapters will be split into each of the tasks in the challenge, except for question 1 for obvious reasons!. Hope you enjoy!

This Project has no real end date, however a **code review deadline** was set for July 31st 2020. Forrest's only request was to hold back our code till after that date, so that will be respected.
