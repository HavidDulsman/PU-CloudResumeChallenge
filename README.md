# #100DaysOfCloud - Cloud Resume Challenge


This project was created in reference to the #100DaysOfCode - Cloud Resume Challenge (https://cloudresumechallenge.dev), created by **Forrest Brazeal** and made popular by the good folks at **r/AWS**. I stumbled upon the project during one of the long days in lockdown towards the end of the challenges lifecycle, but believed it would be a great opportunity for me to brush up on my IT skills, whilst also creating something that would (hopefully!) impress during new job applications. I had alot of fun with the project is it allowed me to be creative with the design of my site, whilst also getting a chance to use some new tools within AWS i had only read up on for my AWS Certified Cloud Practioner Exam, that which i passed 12th June 2020.

This report is merely a log for anyone to look at to see some brief explaination as to my experiences with each task. Chapters will be split into each of the tasks in the challenge, except for question 1 for obvious reasons!. Hope you enjoy!

This Project has no real end date, however a **code review deadline** was set for July 31st 2020. Forrest's only request was to hold back our code till after that date, so that will be respected.

## Referencing my real CV
Below is a copy of my CV, made on word and the same CV I send regarding some of the more technology based jobs. I'm quite proud of the styling and strucuture of my original CV so i was planning to try and emulate the styling to the tee further down the line. Some inspiration was taken from my past experience and the use of HTMl, CSS and JavaScript would allow me to do new things to my CV that wouldnt be possible in a PDF or Word document.

## HTML
HTML is simply a **markup language**, so not much detail will be put into this as its quite easy to grasp! HTML will allow me to use new tools such as **links to my qualifications, email and github accounts** to make the overall experience feel abit more **interactive and unique!**

## CSS
CSS was alot of fun to use and learn. Previous to this project, i had very light (and quite messy!) CSS skills from my experience in early college and university years. Since then, I had no real reason to go back to CSS Styling or much front end development due to my postgraduate focusing alot on the methodologies and uses of technologies in a business sense, and then my 2 recent jobs not really involving the use of CSS. 

CSS allows me to do some cool things with the site, including a **static header** so that my contact details are always at the top, and some similar colour and structure choices!

I did encounter some issues along the way, as my site wasnt properly adapting to smaller screens and mobile devices. I have now learnt to **design for mobiles first**, which makes alot of sense as mobiles are top method of accessing the internet nowadays

## Static S3 Website
I had previous used S3 to store website files or AWS logs that would be accessed by other services and had obviously read about it for my AWS Practitioner Exam, but using S3 to host the websites contents was a really good idea! I was easily to implement thanks to the options AWS displays in the settings.

## HTTPS and DNS
I opted do both of these tasks at the same time, as i knew they would both incorporate alot of the same problems. I had previously bought a domain using **GoDaddy Domains**, however i was having an issue creating a SSL ticket and having accepted with GoDaddy (plus there customer support was horrendous! Would not recommend!). I switched to **AWS Route 53** meaning i could quickly link the domain to through a **CloudFront** host using the same SSL certification.
